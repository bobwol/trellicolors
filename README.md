# Trellicolors

This script converts the Trello brand colors into various formats.

Various formats include…

- LESS variables
- XML (for Android)
- JSON

If you’re just looking for exported file, see `/build`.


# I want to contribute!

Okay! You need to…

- Install node
- Run `npm install`
- And finally, run `npm run convert`

The source is in `/src` and `index.coffee`. `convert` uses nodemon so
your changes (and errors) will show up as soon as you make them.
